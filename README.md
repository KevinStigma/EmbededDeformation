# EmbededDeformation
It's a deformation algorithm I implemented refered to the paper:_Embedded Deformation for Shape Manipulation(Siggraph 2007)_.I use this algorithm to make demo for paper:_Dynamic Furniture Modeling Through Assembly Instructions(Siggraph Asia 2016)_. You can use my code to learn to implement the algorithm. The dependency for this project is here:http://pan.baidu.com/s/1hrIst8o. If you have any implementation or compiling problem, you can send an email to ask me(my email:_kevinstigma@gmail.com_), and I'll try my best to respond to you.:)
